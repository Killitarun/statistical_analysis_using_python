# statistical analysis using python
This repository contains a python notebook focused on applying statistical methods and regression analysis on a health-related dataset. The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle

# Intoduction :
In this project, we explore various statistical techniques and perform regression analysis on a health-related dataset. The aim is to gain insights from the data and interpret the relationship between different variables through statistical methods.
## Statistical analysis :
**1.Descriptive analysis :** Calculation of mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance for all the relevant features in the dataset.
<br>
**2.Hypothesis testing :** We conduct a hypothesis test to check whether a specific feature (e.g., average blood pressure or cholesterol levels) is significantly different from a specified value.
<br>
**3.Confidence interval :** Computation of a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a selected feature (e.g., average BMI, blood pressure).
<br>
<br>
## Regression analysis :
**1.Linear Regression:** Perform linear regression to explore how one feature (independent variable) affects another feature (dependent variable), such as how age affects blood pressure or how BMI impacts disease progression.
<br>
**2.visualizations:** Create visualizations, such as scatter plots with regression lines, to illustrate the relationship between variables.
